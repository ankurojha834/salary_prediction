# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts whether an employee's salary is above or below $50K/year based on various demographic and work-related features. This app is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **Adult Income Dataset** (also known as the "Census Income" dataset). The dataset includes features like:

- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Occupation
- Hours-per-week
- Marital-status
- etc.

✂️ We removed irrelevant data like `Without-pay` and `Never-worked` from the `workclass` column to improve model accuracy.
